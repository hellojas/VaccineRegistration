# Vaccine Registration Tool

This project is a free lightweight web tool for registering, scheduling, notifying, managing, and reporting for COVID-19 vaccinations. It attempt to create digital workflows to help reduce the paperwork burden for small/medium vaccination clinics that may not have the IT infrastructure to build thier own tools.  It only requires a free Google account to host the project using Google Sheets as the database, Google Drive to store images, and Gmail for messages.  Most of the configuration can be done simply be editting a Google Sheet. It is build using [App Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) to create web forms/pages that create, read, and update data in the spreadsheet. 

If [Google Cloud Vision Services](https://cloud.google.com/vision) are enabled on your hosting account, it can also perform text recognition on insurance cards and photo IDs for much faster (and less error prone) check-in process.  This service is free for the first 1000 queries/month, with a [modest cost for additional queries/month](https://cloud.google.com/vision/pricing).
